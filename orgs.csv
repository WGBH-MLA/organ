Colorado Public Television,Colorado Public Television,Denver,CO,http://www.cpt12.org/,"<p>Originally known as KBDI Channel 12, Colorado Public Television (CPT12)
is a unique civic resource and one of the country’s first alternative public television
services. CPT12 provides important local, national and international programming
services that are otherwise not available in Colorado.</p><p>KBDI began operations
in Broomfield, Colorado, with transmitting facilities on Squaw Mountain in Clear
Creek County. At 11,500 feet, the site remains the highest of any full-power television
station in the nation. From there, KBDI began serving first the Denver Metro area,
and then the entire Colorado Front Range.</p><p>Today, Colorado Public Television has
grown to serve 85 percent of the state’s population. Ongoing improvements to its
transmitters and wider digital carriage on cable and satellite systems are extending
the station's reach in almost every direction across the state. Beyond Denver
and the Front Range, CPT12 is increasingly received in various Western Slope and
Eastern Plains communities, ever broadening its service throughout Colorado.</p><p>Since
2003, the station has offered digital programming on three multicast channels.
Today, these three channels include CPT12's flagship signal (12.1), a diverse
mix of local, national and international programming and infused with quality
PBS shows; CPT12+ (12.2), the best of independently produced documentaries, music,
travel, exercise, cooking, public affairs and more; and MHz Worldview (12.3),
a lineup of programs from around the world, including world news, foreign affairs,
international mysteries, world music, sports, and foreign films.</p><p>Frequently stretching
the boundaries of public television, the station has been called many things –
progressive, provocative, experimental, controversial, outrageous, courageous
and more as it has worked to illuminate key social issues, and provide a platform
for the underserved.   CPT12 has always championed experimentation, creativity,
new ideas and high broadcasting standards – all while working on a shoestring
budget.  Today, CPT12 maintains its independent spirit, even as it explores new
media outlets, expands its mission and deepens its community involvement.</p><p>Described
as “the little station that could” by the Denver Post, Colorado Public Television
remains lean and light on its feet – a small, frugal station that continues to
deliver programming that is relevant, informative, entertaining and thought-provoking.</p><p>Colorado
Public Television's tagline, “World View, Community Voice,” represents the station's
mission, programming choices, community activities and engagement with its Colorado
constituents. A global perspective combined with local conversations will continue
to be CPT12's guide into the future.</p>",https://s3.amazonaws.com/americanarchive.org/org-logos/colorado_pt_logo.png,"<p>Colorado Inside Out</p><p>Sounds on 29th</p><p>Studio 12</p><p>Tierra O Muerte:

Connecticut Public Broadcasting,Connecticut Public Broadcasting Network,Hartford,CT,http://www.cpbn.org/,"<p>In October 1962, the Connecticut Educational Television Corporation
began broadcasting over station WEDH-TV (Channel 24) in black and white from the
basement of the Trinity College Library in Hartford, Connecticut. In the beginning,
motivated and eager individuals had a vision: to enrich people's lives through
high-quality, non-commercial, educational programming. Institutions like Trinity
College and the State of Connecticut supported this goal of reaching out to the
community through public broadcasting.</p><p>The station broadcast its first local
children’s programming a few weeks after it went on the air, followed a month
later by a biweekly local series highlighting the world of arts, entertainment
and public affairs in the state. A mobile truck arrived in 1967, color in 1968,
auctions in 1972, and pledge in 1973. By 1974, three additional stations across
the state had joined WEDH-TV and CPTV was born. The statewide network earned its
first Emmy Award in 1977, received its first satellite transmission in 1979, and
taped its first national pledge special in 1985.</p><p>The first public radio station
in Connecticut signed on in June 1978, and soon Connecticut Public Radio (WNPR)
joined CPTV to form what is now known as Connecticut Public Broadcasting. Initially
airing primarily classical and radio music, WNPR now focuses on news and information.
Together, the two community-supported, statewide public broadcasting networks
are dedicated to serving Connecticut with a mix of educational, news, public affairs,
children's and entertainment programming and services. </p><p>Today, CPTV and WNPR
reach the entire state of Connecticut – an estimated 550,000 television viewers
and more than 240,000 radio listeners each week. Connecticut Public Broadcasting
is the state’s only locally owned media organization producing TV, radio, print
and Internet content for distribution to Connecticut’s wide-ranging and diverse
communities.</p>",https://s3.amazonaws.com/americanarchive.org/org-logos/cpbn_logo.png,"<p>Mundo Real (CPTV, 1976-1978) - One of the first television series
to focus on a Puerto Rican family, Mundo Real was a Spanish-English bilingual
educational children’s series aimed at ages 7-11. It was funded by four successive
grants from the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare.  A total of
39 episodes were produced. The series was syndicated to commercial and public
television stations throughout the country, airing on at least 60 in 1978 and
PBS aired episodes nationally in 1981.  </p><p>Open Air New England / The Faith Middleton
Show (WNPR, 1981-Present) - The two-time Peabody Award-winning Faith Middleton
Show has been widely recognized for fostering insightful, thought-provoking conversation
for more than 30 years. Faith offers her listeners some of the world's most fascinating
people and subjects. The show has been inducted into the Connecticut Magazine
Hall of Fame as “Best Local Talk Show.” </p><p>Barney &amp; Friends (CPTV, 1992-2005) -
For over a decade, CPTV co-produced Barney &amp; Friends for PBS. A CPTV executive
thought Barney might be a good fit for television after renting a Barney video
for his daughter. When it premiered in April 1992, the series was a huge hit,
far more popular than anyone could have possibly imagined. </p><p>CPTV UConn Women's
Basketball (CPTV, 1994-2012) - CPTV was the TV broadcast home of the phenomenally
successful UConn Women’s Basketball team for 18 years. With some of the consistently
highest ratings and strongest membership levels of any program on public television
for close to two decades, UConn Women’s Basketball on CPTV is considered by many
to be the most successful local franchise in public television history. </p><p>Infinity
Hall Live (CPTV, 2011-Present) - Since 2011, CPTV has produced and distributed
nationally to public television stations across the country this Emmy-award winning
series that provides an all-access pass to engaging performances and backstage
conversations with today’s most intriguing musical artists. It offers authentic
and heartfelt performances taped at Infinity Music Hall, an acoustically perfect
Victorian-era concert hall in Norfolk, CT. Artists featured on the series include
The Barenaked Ladies, Joan Osborne, Fountains of Wayne, Tori Amos, and Wilson
Phillips.</p>"

Illinois Public Media (WILL),WILL Illinois Public Media,Urbana,IL,http://will.illinois.edu/,"<p>The radio station that became WILL first signed on the air on March
27th, 1922 on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The
initial call letters were WRM for “We Reach Millions,” which was likely an overstatement
since the station shared its transmitter tube with faculty in the Department of
Electrical Engineering. But by the late 1920s, WILL-AM was broadcasting a regular
schedule of news, music performances, and programs intended to extend the educational
mission of the University of Illinois across the entire state.</p><p>In 1941 WILL-FM
signed on as the first FM radio station licensed to a university. Station engineers
wired 20 buildings across the campus to allow live broadcasts of classroom lectures
and public events. WILL broadcast many pivotal moments in our nation’s history,
through the Great Depression, World War II, the Cold War, the Civil Rights Movement,
and the tumultuous social changes in the 1960s and 70s. Recordings of many of
these broadcasts were preserved in the University of Illinois Archives, and are
now becoming part of the American Archive. </p><p>In 1951 the newly-formed National
Association of Educational Broadcasters began delivering programs to noncommercial
radio stations across then United States from Gregory Hall in Urbana, Illinois,
the home of WILL Radio. The NAEB network emerged from conferences at the University
of Illinois’ Allerton House, underwritten by the Rockefeller Foundation, which
led to a growing recognition of the need for a national system of public broadcasting.
In 1961 the NAEB moved its headquarters from the Urbana campus to Washington D.C.
to be closer to the campaign to win federal support for creation of a public television
and radio system.</p><p>WILL-TV signed on in 1955, broadcasting programs produced by
WILL and other educational broadcasters. Throughout the 1950s and 60s, WILL-TV
aired a mix of telecourses offered by university departments, along with news,
documentaries, and children’s programming. </p><p>With the signing of the Public Broadcasting
Act of 1967, what had been known as educational broadcasting became part of an
emerging public broadcasting system. WILL joined the PBS and National Public Radio
networks as they became central points for television and radio program distribution.
During the 1970s, programming on WILL Radio and Television became more focused
on news and public affairs, as part of the growing national network of professional
public broadcasting stations. </p><p>With the emergence of the World Wide Web, WILL
embraced a new model of multi-platform content production and distribution. With
“digital first” becoming the mantra of the Internet age, WILL has worked to innovate
more effective ways of producing and distributing “born digital” content, while
preserving the rich historical record contained in its media archives.</p>",https://s3.amazonaws.com/americanarchive.org/org-logos/will_logo.png,<p>Illinois Broadcast Archives</p><p>African American Life in Central Illinois</p><p>WILL News</p><p>Focus 580</p><p>The Afternoon Magazine</p><p>Central Illinois World War II Stories</p>

used gifts from George Powell, Sr. and John Francis to provide for the 
establishment of a non-profit agency to create a public television station 
for Kansas City and the surrounding areas of Kansas and Missouri. Ownership

(MSU), Bozeman.  With 90 live announcers playing their choice of music 22 hours
per day, KGLT produces 1,500 to 2,000 public service announcements and offers
three DJ apprentice classes yearly.   Approximately one third of the public service
announcements (PSAs) relate to campus offerings such as new classes, recreational
and volunteer opportunities, events, and informing students and employees committees
and programs in existence to help and protect them: diversity, women's issues,
returning vet issues, handicap rights, rape alerts, and drunk driver ride home options.
Public service issues on and off campus include AIDS awareness, medical care and
preventative options, LBGTQ support, bullying, parenting, and environmental awareness.
The KGLT website hosts a Community Calendar that announces lectures, concerts,
classes, nature programs, and exhibits in all areas where there are radio signals.
Environmentally, Montana is a rare combination of being an ‘AG’ or agricultural
state, because of all the ranching and farming, and a state also focused on maintaining
its land untainted by industry.  Montana is dependent on the tourist trade for
fishing, hiking, and hunting as well as summer and winter recreation.  It is one
of the only states making a conscientious effort for a meeting of the minds of
the ranchers and outdoors enthusiasts.  As a result, there is a lot of informative
and educational discussion offered and shared as PSAs on the air. </p><p>The audiences
reached are diverse; KGLT ranks in the top 25% of 21 stations in Gallatin County
and collaborates with NPR stations in Montana.   KGLT is the matriarch of community
radio in the state of Montana, offering openness, inclusiveness, and commitment
to community.  The goal for KGLT is to reach more listeners in order to offer
them this familial yet professional inclusivity, so that they may benefit from
the information and education KGLT provides in music and public service.</p><p>Apprentice

KNBA-FM,Koahnic Broadcast Corporation,Anchorage,AK,http://knba.org/,"<p>Koahnic Broadcast Corporation was created as a non-profit media corporation
in 1992 by Alaska Native leaders to preserve culture and languages, combat widespread
misconceptions and prejudices against Alaska Natives, and create cross-cultural
bridges. Since our creation, Koahnic Broadcast Corporation has been a national
leader in Native American radio broadcasting, media production, and training.</p><p>Koahnic operates KNBA 90.3 FM in Anchorage, Alaska, the first urban Native radio
station, which signed on in October 1996. KNBA broadcasts news, public affairs
and contemporary music to Anchorage and surrounding areas, and streams its signal
online. KNBA also produces special programming, such as annual broadcast coverage
of the Alaska Federation of Natives Convention that is carried by stations across
the state.</p><p>Koahnic is the nation’s primary producer and distributor of Native
public radio programming. Koahnic’s award-winning national radio programs include:
Native America Calling, a weekday one-hour live moderated call-in program; National
Native News, a weekday 5-minute news feature that has been recognized repeatedly
by the Native American Journalists Association; and Earthsongs, a dynamic weekly
feature spotlighting contemporary Native music. </p><p>Starting in 2006, Koahnic has
operated Native Voice One (NV1), the national Native radio program distribution
service. Through NV1 distribution, Native radio programs reach the majority of
the Alaska Native population and the American Indian reservation audience through
carriage by most of the country’s 55 Native-owned stations. NV1 programs are also
heard on public radio stations serving urban areas including Atlanta, Orlando,
Phoenix, and Sacramento, as well as smaller cities like Duluth, Minnesota; Bloomington,
Indiana; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Asheville, North Carolina. </p><p>NV1 station affiliation
includes 400 public radio stations and repeaters, including 50 Native stations
in rural communities. Many more listeners access the NV1 and KNBA webstreams on
mobile devices to hear these shows that are engaging Native America.</p>",https://s3.amazonaws.com/americanarchive.org/org-logos/koahnic_logo.png,"<p>National Native News (NNN) - a daily five-minute newscast, has

is the only news program of this kind produced and anchored entirely by a Native
staff.  Broadcast Monday through Friday on more than 300 U.S. and Canadian radio
stations and their translators, NNN is anchored and produced by Antonia Gonzales
(Navajo), with reporters contributing stories from across the country.</p><p>Native
America Calling (NAC) - broadcast live nationwide, is an intense and stimulating
one-hour call-in radio talk show. NAC is produced by Koahnic five days a week
and broadcast via NV1 to stations across the country. There is no other national
forum in any medium for this kind of exchange on Native issues. Native and non-Native
leaders in government, business and the arts recognize this and take advantage
of the opportunity to participate in NAC’s talking circle. Both members of rural
and reservation Native communities and Native people listening from urban areas
may call in and speak directly to people closest to Native issues. Since 1995
NAC has provided links between Native and non-Native people, enabling callers
to speak out on a variety of subjects that educate and enlighten their communities
and other public radio audiences. Hosted by Tara Gatewood (Isleta), the program
is broadcast on nearly 100 Native and public radio stations and translators.</p><p>Earthsongs
- a weekly public radio program produced in Alaska and distributed nationally
via NV1. Since 1999, Earthsongs has been the primary showcase for contemporary
Native American and Indigenous music and culture. Hosted and produced by Alexis
Sallee (Iñupiaq and Mexican-American), the hour-long program is carried by nearly
100 public radio stations across 16 states, and streamed online. Each hour of
Earthsongs features exclusive artist interviews, and a carefully curated mix of
music by both emerging and established Native musicians.  </p><p>The Alaska Federation
of Natives (AFN) Convention is the largest representative annual gathering in
the United States of any Native peoples. Each year, the AFN Convention draws between
4,000–5,000 attendees. Policy guidelines and advocacy statements are set by the
dozens of resolutions passed by voting delegates at the Convention. Since 1996,
KNBA has produced and broadcast statewide, gavel-to-gavel coverage of this important
three-day event. The broadcasts are aired on KNBA, streamed online, and made available
to stations across the state. In the last decade, KNBA has added additional coverage
from the event, including daily five-minute newscasts both in English and in Native
languages including Iñupiaq, Athabascan, Tlingit and Yup’ik, and a special hour-long
discussion program, “Alaska’s Native Voice.” KNBA’s live, statewide broadcasts
from the AFN Convention provide an important service to Alaskans, enabling listeners
to stay in touch with important discussions and debates. </p><p>2010 Inuit Nipaat Radio
- Koahnic Broadcast Corporation was the invited United States media provider for
the 2010 General Assembly of the Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC) in Nuuk, Greenland.
“Nipaat” is a Greenlandic and Iñupiaq word meaning “Sound,” and the broadcast’s
title was chosen to reflect the concept that this special coverage had a distinct
“Inuit Sound” or “Inuit Voice” to speak to Native people throughout the circumpolar
region. Koahnic provided context, detail and analysis throughout the four-day
proceedings with daily broadcasts. As part of the broadcasts, Koahnic produced
five-minute recaps of each day's proceedings in English, Iñupiaq, Yup'ik and Greenlandic.
The program was aired not only by KNBA in Anchorage, but by rural stations serving
communities throughout Alaska including in Dillingham, Nome, Bethel, Chevak, Kotzebue,
Barrow and Sand Point.</p>"

in a new field referred to as the “educational TV movement.” Conceived initially
as a teaching tool, the station quickly broadened its scope to include entertainment
and public affairs programming. The young station made a name for itself by airing
the famous 1958 Teller-Pauling debate on nuclear fallout as well as controversial
inquiries into homosexuality, racial prejudice and communism. </p><p>KQED originated
the idea of selling memberships, staging an annual auction and developing other
fundraising methods that became widespread throughout the public television system.</p><p>During the 1968 San Francisco newspaper strike, KQED founded Newspaper of the
Air, public television’s first daily news program. Ten years later, KQED, for
the first time, broadcasts a full seven-day schedule with the addition of Saturday
afternoon programming.</p><p>KQED Public Radio became the first station — commercial
or noncommercial — to try an all-news format on FM. On August 12, 1987, the station
changed format from a classical music station that also aired Morning Edition
and All Things Considered to an all news and information station. Two years later,
KQED Public Radio becomes an around-the-clock, in-depth news and public affairs
broadcasting station on July 1. In 1993, it is the most-listened-to public radio
station in the country.</p><p>In January 1995, KQED publicly launched its website featuring
program listings, press releases and content from San Francisco Focus magazine.
And five years later, KQED-TV enters the digital age by broadcasting a high definition
signal and soon launched five new digital channels: KQED HD, KQED Encore, KQED
World, KQED Life and KQED Kids.</p><p>In 2011, KQED Public Radio becomes not only the
most-listened-to public radio station in the nation, but the most-listened-to
radio station in the Bay Area. KQED Public Television defies the national curve
by increasing viewership, which often places it as the most-watched public television
station in America. Usage of KQED's online and mobile services has more than tripled
in the past 18 months -- and that was before the launch of the KQED iPhone app.
With the development of public media's first radio Pledge Free Stream and the
use of social media with thousands of friends and subscribers on Facebook, Twitter
and Interactive blogs, KQED's reach continues to expand. That April, KQED rolls
out an alternative to the classic pledge drive that April. The Pledge-Free Stream
was the first time any public radio station offered members the option of listening
on their computers or smartphones without pledge-break interruptions. </p><p>In December
2012, KQED entered into an innovative partnership with the Knight Foundation to
create Matter Ventures, a startup accelerator and early-stage venture capital
fund that supports and invests in media entrepreneurs working to create a more
informed, connected and empowered society.</p><p>By 2014, KQED Public Television stations

Lucille Woodard flipped a ceremonial switch to sign WLPB on in Baton Rouge. It
was the culmination of three years of hard work after the Legislature approved
the creation of the Louisiana Educational Television Authority. </p><p>Woodard, a professor
at LSU, started working in the 1950s to get educational television throughout
the state. After decades of frustrated efforts, the Louisiana Educational Television
Authority was created in 1971 and the money to start the state network was appropriated.</p><p>KLTM-TV in Monroe was the second LPB station to go on the air in 1976, followed
by KLTS in Shreveport and KLPB in Lafayette in 1978. KLTL in Lake Charles signed
on in 1981 and KLPA-TV in Alexandria went on the air in 1983. LPB has also entered
into a partnership with WLAE-TV32 in New Orleans, which gives LPB a presence in
the Crescent City.</p><p>Louisiana: The State We’re In was started in 1976 with current
Executive Director/CEO Beth Courtney as host and producer. The only statewide
magazine in Louisiana, it has garnered many journalism and public affairs awards
during its 38-year history. </p><p>Our first nationally–syndicated show was Justin
Wilson’s Louisiana Cooking.  Our 13th series with Chef John Folse, Hook Lies and
Alibis, premiered in 2015.</p><p>Documentaries about Louisiana and its “unique” politics
have always been a major part of LPB’s locally produced programming. LPB combined
with rising filmmaker Ken Burns (The Civil War) to produce Huey Long. Other award-winning
documentaries produced or co-produced by LPB have included Uncle Earl and Lindy
Boggs: Steel &amp; Velvet.</p><p>The six-part series Louisiana: A History, LPB’s biggest
and most lauded project to date, premiered in September 2003 to coincide with
the 200th anniversary of the Louisiana Purchase. </p><p>Preserving and showcasing our
state’s history has always been a goal for LPB. Documentaries such as Signpost
to Freedom: The 1953 Baton Rouge Bus Boycott and Against the Tide: The Story of
the Cajun People of Louisiana have all explored little-known aspects of our past
and present. </p><p>In the 1990s, LPB produced a wide range of documentaries about
our state’s artists, including Ernest Gaines: Louisiana Stories, Frame After Frame:
The Images of Herman Leonard, and Kate Chopin: A Re-Awakening.</p><p>When Hurricanes
Katrina and Rita devastated South Louisiana and New Orleans, LPB documented the
heroic actions of rescuers through Katrina’s Smallest Victims and the stories
of the storm survivors trying to put the lives back together in American Creole
and Washing Away: Losing Louisiana.</p><p>LPB has continued to turn out award-winning
documentaries. In 2012 the network was chosen to create the official documentary
for the state’s 200th anniversary of joining the Union, Louisiana: 200 Years of
Statehood.  When a program was needed to kick off the Year of Music in 2013, LPB
joined forces with the Lt. Governor’s Office and Harry Connick, Jr. to create
Sunshine By the Stars: Celebrating Louisiana Music. It featured an all-star lineup

Maine Public Broadcasting,Maine Public Broadcasting Network,Lewiston,ME,http://mainepublic.org/,"<p>The Maine Public Broadcasting Network is a statewide dual licensee
providing both television and radio service throughout the state of Maine. MPBN’s
television service is also available in the Canadian maritime provinces and Quebec.</p><p>Today’s
MPBN is a result of a 1992 merger between Lewiston, Maine based WCBB and Orono,
Maine based WMEB. </p><p>WCBB TV was founded by Colby College, Bates College and Bowdoin
College and signed on as the first educational television service in Maine on
November 13, 1961. It served the southern and western parts of the state and the
studio was based in Lewiston.</p><p>WMEB TV was founded by the University of Maine
system and first went to air on October 7, 1963. Among its programs was the “Friendly
Giant” and “History with Herb Hake”.  In 1964, transmitters are constructed in
Presque Isle and Calais bringing educational television to northern and eastern
Maine.  In 1974 another transmitter is built to serve southern Maine. This group
of stations becomes known as the Maine Public Broadcasting Network in 1971. Based
on the University of Maine campus it moves to larger facilities in Bangor in 1987.</p><p>In
1970, MPBN launched WMEH-FM, Maine’s first public radio service.</p><p>WCBB and MPBN
collaborated many times over the years but finally merged to form a single entity
in July of 1992. After several name changes in the ensuing years, MPBN is chosen
to represent both the television and radio services.</p><p>Five television transmitters
and seven radio transmitters form the statewide backbone of the transmission system.
MPBN television provides one HD and three SD channels in its digital broadcast
stream: regular PBS programming with occasional local productions (HD), MPBN Create
(SD), MPBN World (SD) and a fourth channel which is used for seasonal coverage
of the Maine Legislature (SD).</p>",https://s3.amazonaws.com/americanarchive.org/org-logos/mpbn_logo.png,"<p>The News Machine, and its French language counterpart La Machine
Magique - began in 1974. This weekly half-hour was a news program aimed at grade
school students. The French version was added to serve the French Acadian population
of far northern Maine. Both series ran in the mid 1970s.</p><p>La Bonne Aventure -
a 20 episode series devoted to French heritage received national distribution
and acclaim in 1976. In 1979 MPBN broadcast the Maine State High School Basketball
Tournaments. This annual production continues to this day and features 44 live
games from three locations played over the course of 2 weeks each February and
garners some of the highest ratings of the year. </p><p>Maine Watch - launched in 1987.
This weekly public affairs program ran until 2013 and included as one of its hosts
the future Maine Governor and U.S. Senator Angus King. </p><p>Maine Capitol Connection- daily live coverage of Maine’s legislative activities, began on February 6, 2013

Maryland Public Television,Maryland Public Television,Owings Mills,MD,http://www.mpt.org/,"<p>In 1966, an act of the Maryland Legislature established the Maryland
Educational-Cultural Television Commission, the governance body of what became
known as the Maryland Center for Public Broadcasting and, later, Maryland Public
Television. Ground was broken for a headquarters and studio facility in suburban
Baltimore County’s community of Owings Mills on June 5, 1968, and the center went
on the air on October 5, 1969.  The founding executive director, Dr. Frederick
Breitenfeld, Jr., already a leading figure in public broadcasting at the time
of his appointment, served as chief executive for 17 years.</p><p>The center was established
as a nonprofit, state-licensed public television network and member of the Public
Broadcasting Service (PBS).  The state license required statewide reach, and so
six towers across the state enabled MPT to get its then-analog signal to all corners
of Maryland and into contiguous states and the District of Columbia.  In 1976,
the center initiated its first satellite communications project, linking two universities
in a law school moot court competition some 22,300 miles in space.</p><p>The 1970s
and 1980s saw the introduction of an astounding variety of center-produced historical
dramas, how-to programs, nature, and music offerings in addition to educational
and cultural programming. It was during this time that several MPT series enjoyed
their premieres and what would become decades-long popularity among viewers locally
and nationally.  MPT was rewarded for is production prowess with dozens of Emmy®
Awards (four of them national and the remainder regional) along with an impressive
list of other major broadcasting honors.</p><p>In 1984, the name Maryland Center for
Public Broadcasting gave way to Maryland Public Television. In 2004, MPT began
broadcasting in both analog and digital formats until digital-only transmission
started in 2009.  In 2007, MPT introduced V-me, a 24-hour Spanish language channel,
which joined MPT’s two other digital channels, the primary MPT-HD and secondary
channel MPT2, in the daily programming lineup. </p><p>MPT has been a pioneer in the
production, delivery and dissemination of pre-K-12 educational resources and online
courses. The award-winning education website Thinkport.org, launched in 2003,
offers high-quality lesson plans, digital media, learning games and resources
for educators, schools, the child care population, and families.  </p><p>Another MPT
educational endeavor, started in the late 1960s, came out of the State Department
of Education’s formation of a Division of Instructional Television.   ITV, as
it was known, was awarded one-third of the Maryland Center for Public Broadcasting’s
available production facilities, staff, and program schedule. By 1980-81 over
42% of Maryland teachers were using instructional television. </p><p>In 1970, College
of the Air debuted, as the center became the largest U.S. producer of telecourses
for credit. Today, via Thinkport, the platform for learning has expanded to embrace
online and mobile technologies, but MPT remains committed to being Maryland’s
sole statewide educator just as it was in the 1970s and ‘80s.  </p><p>Starting in 2007,
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting funded MPT to participate in the the American
Archive inventory of public media content. Working on a tight deadline of five
months beginning in late summer and finishing in December 2011, an MPT team worked
3,500 hours and was able to inventory almost 48,000 assets.</p><p>Today, under the
leadership of CEO Larry D. Unger, MPT’s fifth president, some 140 staff members
continue to produce award-winning local and national public television programs,
to provide distinctive online content and community outreach initiatives, and
to offer an impressive array of educational resources for children, teachers,
families, and daycare providers across the state and nationally.</p>",https://s3.amazonaws.com/americanarchive.org/org-logos/mpt_logo.png,"<ul>

linked microwave towers. Appleton Minnesota was identified by the FCC as a logical
location for a new link in this network because the station could bring television
to this under served rural region and act as a relay point to carry educational
television programming via microwave signal to other stations in the network.</p><p>After
several years of fundraising, the station raised enough federal, state and foundation
support to get started.  $22,000 of this support was contributed locally by individuals,
businesses, clubs, associations, and churches from Appleton and dozens of surrounding
communities. Many of these gifts were $1, $2, and $5 donations from individual
families offering what they could afford.  The Alvin Lia family donated 8 acres
of farmland to serve as the tower site.   School District 2202 donated its old
one-room schoolhouse to hold the television equipment and controls.  A 500-foot
tower was erected at the transmission site and on February 7, 1966, KWCM-TV broadcast
its first educational program.</p><p>Early plans called for the station to collect
$30,000 a year in operational funds from area schools.  By 1969 however, only
41 schools were paying membership fees.  It was clear that a more sustainable
funding model needed to be created.  In 1975, KWCM premiered its first locally
developed program. In 1976, PBS and CPB selected Appleton as a site for a satellite
receiving ground terminal, giving the station access to a larger selection of
programs.  In 1980 the board and management advanced a vision to become more responsive
to local people through programs that featured the family farms and small towns
of the region. In March 1980, KWCM broadcast its first membership drive.   In
a few short years, membership and revenues doubled and soon KWCM had a new home
in Appleton's Old City Hall, which was constructed in 1895 and is listed on the
National Register of Historic Places.</p><p>In 1983,  the City of Appleton received
a grant to construct a conjoined building for additional KWCM offices and studios.
At that time the station was rebranded to be called Pioneer Public Television
and in 1985, a new 1,200-foot tower was installed at the transmission site.  In
October 1996, a second tower tower and transmitter building was constructed in
Chandler, Minnesota and a new sister station, KSMN, began broadcasting. In February
1999, another new Pioneer low power TV signal, K49FA, began broadcasting from
Fergus Falls, completing Pioneer’s broadcast signal expansion.</p><p>In  1996, a  new
local program, “Funtime Polka,” premiered. The 1990s also saw the debut of  “Prairie
Sportsman.” In 2000, Pioneer produced “Country Spires,”  a documentary about rural
churches in the Midwest that was broadcast on public television stations across
the country.</p><p>In 2009 Pioneer began producing “Postcards,”  a weekly magazine
program exploring the arts, history and cultural heritage of western Minnesota.
In 2013, Pioneer’s first Upper Midwest Regional Emmy was awarded to “Caroline
Smith: My Way Back Home.”  In 2014 Pioneer was awarded an Upper Midwest Emmy for
Haiti Love.</p><p>As a result of the conversion to digital TV, which was completed in
2010, Pioneer now broadcasts four digital channels to a viewing area that reaches
from Detroit Lakes, MN to Rock Rapids, IA.  Through Dish Network and DirecTV,
Pioneer’s signal can be viewed from western Wisconsin to the Missouri River.  In
2011, Pioneer launched its website <a href=""http://www.pioneer.org"">www.pioneer.org</a> for online streaming of local
programs and PBS content.</p><p>Pioneer is currently  advancing plans to construct
a new studio, performance space, and office space for the station. Working in
concert with the City of Appleton, the proposal is to relocate the City’s currently
cramped public library to Pioneer’s existing 1983 office building. In addition,
plans call for a restoration of the historic Opera House so it can once again
serve as an active performance venue and community hub. Finally, the proposal
calls for the construction of a new Pioneer production and office facility (adjacent
to the Old Opera House) that would allow the station to meet the growing need
for meaningful content and digital communications infrastructure in the region.</p><p>From
the “Little Red TV Schoolhouse” to <a href=""http://www.pioneer.org"">www.pioneer.org</a>, the West Central Educational
Television Company has continued to educate and sustain rural communities through
communications services that reflect and uphold local values. Pioneer Public Television
is a rare example of how democratic greater-good principles and small town cooperative
values have been applied to the sophisticated world of broadcast communications.</p>","","<p>Haiti Love</p><p>My Way Back Home:  Holly Hansen</p><p>My Way Back Home:

Prairie Public Broadcasting,Prairie Public Broadcasting,Fargo,ND,http://www.prairiepublic.org/,"<p>What began with a hand-me-down trailer house headquarters and television
transmitter tower on the edge of Fargo, North Dakota, is now a television and
radio network that serves North Dakota, portions of its border states, and several
communities in Manitoba, Canada. In service to households in the region for 50
years, Prairie Public is not showing signs of being over-the-hill. Rather, it
continues to embrace technological advances in the medium while remaining remarkably
close to the same mission it has had from the beginning—to deliver programs that
educate, involve, and inspire, without commercial interruption. </p><p>The organization
was conceived in August of 1959 when a forward-thinking Dr. Ted Donat presided
over the incorporation of the North Central Educational Television Association.
In July of 1963, after nearly four years of planning and development, the first
employee was hired, and North Central Educational Television was about to go live.
The Association’s first station, KFME-TV (Channel 13, Fargo), aired its first
broadcast in January of 1964.</p><p>That first public television signal was an abbreviated
three-hour schedule. Prairie Public’s first local production, an English Literature
course for Moorhead Minnesota’s Concordia College, began in 1965. KFME began broadcasting
in color in 1967, the same year President Johnson signed The Public Broadcasting
Act. </p><p>North Central Educational Television had a growth spurt in the ‘70s, changed
its name to Prairie Public Television, and expanded its broadcast area to include
the entire state of North Dakota. In the ‘80s, radio broadcasts were added, and
the brand has since changed to Prairie Public.</p><p>Prairie Public is proud of its
award-winning television documentaries, including an award-winning series about
the history and culture of the Germans from Russia, a series of documentaries
in collaboration with the Plains CO2 Reduction Partnership led by the University
of North Dakota’s Energy &amp; Environmental Research Center, the nationally broadcast
“Painting with Paulson” art instruction series, and documentaries about Homesteading,
Prairie Churches, the Old Red Trail, Scandinavian Traditions, regional artists
and musicians, and many more.</p><p>Prairie Public has embraced new technology, adding
web content, social media communications and online viewing and listening. The
switch from analogue to digital broadcasting—Prairie Public was the first in the
region to do so—allowed for more great programming for schools, more hours of
non-violent children’s programming for families, and the stunning clarity of high-definition
television. Just as the public adjusted from black and white color back in the
‘60’s, large high-definition televisions have become the norm in most households
as Prairie Public turns 50.</p>",https://s3.amazonaws.com/americanarchive.org/org-logos/prairie_logo.png,""

1956, as Denver’s instructional TV station licensed to Denver Public Schools.
As Denver’s first educational station, it broadcast for only two hours that
inaugural day from a temporary studio in the Emily Griffith Opportunity School
in downtown Denver.  KRMA was the 5th TV station to go on air in the Denver metro
area and was Denver’s first non-commercial station.  It was the 18th educational
television station in the country.</p><p>Records show that as early as 1950, the Denver
Public Schools, Denver Public Library, The University of Denver, the Rocky Mountain
Radio Council of Denver and the Adult Education Council met to discuss educational
television for Denver. In 1952, a community meeting was held to discuss the idea.
This followed the FCC’s action to set aside 242 channels in the VHG and UHF
frequencies for nonprofit educational stations.  In the fall of 1953, the Denver
Area Council for Educational Television was established to oversee the work and
mission of KRMA for more than 30 years.</p><p>On May 1, 1987, the Denver Public Schools
transferred the license to the Council for Public Television, Channel 6, Inc.
Following this decision, KRMA started a capital campaign to raise $14.5 million
to move on October 30, 1992 to its current studios in Denver at 1089 Bannock Street.
Rocky Mountain PBS continues to be at this location today and has expanded its
presence in Colorado by adding two additional studios, KTSC (Pueblo/Colorado Springs)
and KRMJ (Grand Junction).</p><p>In recent years, Rocky Mountain PBS has expanded by
merging with <a href=""http://inewsnetwork.org/"">I-News</a>, a Colorado-based nonprofit that
produces in-depth journalism for media outlets across the region and <a href=""http://kuvo.drupal.publicbroadcasting.net/"">KUVO Radio</a>,

to reassign channel 8 from Brookings to Medford. OEB intended to make channel
8 the third station in its television network, which at that time included flagship
KOAC-TV in Corvallis and KOAP-TV (now KOPB-TV) in Portland. Southern Oregon was
the only region of the state without public television. However, OEB backed out
after a protracted battle with several commercial applicants. The license eventually
went to Liberty Television, owners of KEZI-TV in Eugene.</p><p>The owners of the two
commercial stations in the area, Bill Smullin of KTVM-TV (now KOBI) and Ray Johnson
of KMED-TV (now KTVL), helped a new nonprofit corporation, Southern Oregon Educational
Company (SOEC), buy the channel 8 construction permit from Liberty. They also
pledged payments of $50,000 once the station signed on. Getting the funds to sign
on proved more difficult than expected. With the FCC permit about to run out,
KSYS went on the air on January 17, 1977 with the strongest signal of any station
in the region, at 191,000 watts. This was still not enough to cover Klamath Falls,
and SOEC (later renamed Southern Oregon Public Television, Inc.) immediately applied
for another station to cover that region. However, it took 12 more years before
KFTS went on the air in January 1989.</p><p>The two stations are the only public television

for North Carolina, reaching all 100 counties with four channels of national and
local program content, as well as parts of Virginia, South Carolina, Tennessee
and Georgia.  A lot has changed since WUNC-TV in Chapel Hill signed on as the
nation’s tenth “educational television” station on January 8, 1955, largely due
to the efforts of three visionary leaders.  William C. “Billy” Carmichael, the
University of North Carolina’s vice president for finance, University alumnus
and famous band lead Kay Kyser, and eventual university president William Friday
– then the assistant to the university’s president, Gordon Gray – spearheaded
an effort to use the burgeoning power of television to bring non-commercial educational
content to the citizens of the state.  This group recognized the unique opportunity
when the Federal Communications Commission offered eight channels in North Carolina
for non-commercial uses in 1952.  They traveled the state marshaling contributions
and support for both public and private funding, and so UNC-TV was born.</p><p>William
Friday became president of the university system in 1957, and during his legendary
30 year tenure in that position, he continued to be a powerful and effective advocate
for the importance and value of public television.  Gradually, it transitioned
from an operation run primarily by students and faculty members to a fully professional
broadcasting organization.  With the advent of PBS in 1968, UNC-TV was transformed
from the old educational television model to being a source for mission-driven
programming for general audiences.  In the meantime, UNC-TV continued to expand
its reach, gradually adding transmitter sites to cover more of the state.  In
1979, the University of North Carolina Center for Public Television was established
by the university’s board of governors, and 10 years later operations were finally
consolidated in one location, the network’s current headquarters and studios in
Research Triangle Park.</p><p>In many ways, the much-beloved William Friday was the
face of UNC-TV.  In addition to his advocacy and leadership as university president,
he was also the host of the longest-running program in UNC-TV history, North Carolina
People with William Friday.  The program went on the air in 1971 and continued
its weekly run until President Friday passed away at the age of 92 in October,
2012.  In a warm and informal one-on-one interview format, Friday engaged North
Carolinians from all walks of life, from the exalted to the humble, coaxing out
the stories that make every life interesting, and his viewing audience remained
loyal throughout his life. In 2014 the Board of Governors of the National Academy
of Television Arts and Sciences, Nashville/Midsouth Chapter, honored William Friday
with posthumous induction as the inaugural member of its Gold Circle for his exceptional
service to the advancement of public television.  At the same time, the chapter
also presented UNC-TV with its Governor’s Award in recognition of the network’s
history of exemplary service to the state of North Carolina.</p><p>Today, UNC-TV not
only brings programming from PBS, the BBC and other sources to the entire state,
it produces more than 300 hours of original programming each year for and about
North Carolina.  Looking to the future, UNC-TV continues extending its content
into the ever-growing array of digital platforms, and expanding its mission to
include even more opportunities for public service.</p>",https://s3.amazonaws.com/americanarchive.org/org-logos/unctv_logo.png,<p>North Carolina People with William Friday</p>

WBRA-TV,Blue Ridge PBS,Roanoke,VA,http://www.blueridgepbs.org/,"<p>In 1965, a group of concerned citizens and educators established
the Blue Ridge Educational Television (ETV) Association, with the goal of bringing
educational television to Southwest Virginia. With seed money from the City of
Roanoke and funding from nineteen area school systems, ETV then applied for state
and federal grants to build the facilities. Groundbreaking for the studio building
took place November 1966.</p><p>On August 1, 1967, Southwest Virginia’s own public
television station went on the air for the very first time as Blue Ridge Educational
Television, WBRA-TV, channel 15—broadcasting from its new production facility
in Roanoke. It was the nation's first all-color educational television station.
WBRA’s all-color capabilities brought national attention in 1968 when RCA’s “Broadcast
News Magazine” did an extensive layout about the station. Initially there were
no broadcasts on weekends, and the station signed off every weekday at 11 p.m.
Within those broadcast hours, WBRA staff were offering an alternative to commercial
television.   In addition to broadcasts for schools, WBRA began the tradition
of providing quality entertainment programming.</p><p>Color programming was especially
popular with educators who were using WBRA broadcasts in classrooms. During the
school year, the station aired nearly seven hours of instructional programming
every weekday. At that time, the station employed six studio teachers who led
the daily televised lessons, which covered subjects such as science, music, geography,
and economics. In 1969, instruction and entertainment were expertly combined when
“Sesame Street” and “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” were added to WBRA’s schedule.</p><p>For the first few years, WBRA’s reach was limited to portions of 15 counties
surrounding the City of Roanoke. With the addition of two more transmitters, Blue
Ridge PBS expanded its coverage area to the farthest corners of Southwest Virginia
and into bordering counties in Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, and North Carolina—a
total of 26,000 square-miles. WSBN in Norton went on the air in 1971, and WMSY
in Marion completed the trio of Blue Ridge PBS’ stations when it went on the air
in 1981.</p><p>Today people travel the world with Blue Ridge PBS, visiting distant
destinations as well as special places and people across the Blue Ridge region.
Blue Ridge PBS, still community owned, has grown into a 21st century, multimedia
organization. It is now the region’s story teller, serving 2.5 million individuals
as an around-the-clock source for thoughtful news and documentaries, arts and
culture programming, and the best in children’s television.</p><p>In recent years,
investments in digital technologies have enabled Blue Ridge PBS to triple the
amount of programming available to regional viewers. Viewers can now choose from
three digital channels: Blue Ridge PBS, Southwest Virginia Public TV and World.</p>",https://s3.amazonaws.com/americanarchive.org/org-logos/wbra_logo.png,"<p>Blue Ridge Nightline was a public affairs show that was on the
air for over 20 years covering a wide variety of topics.  The show had a number
of title variations over the years as hosts changed.  Several episodes of Hake
Wheeler’s Nightline were part of the collection we digitized for the archives
project.   </p><p>Blue Ridge PBS worked with nationally known historian, James I. Robertson,
Jr. to produce a 10 part series on the Civil War.</p><p>In addition, the station produced
a 3 hour documentary on Virginia in the Civil War to commemorate the 150th anniversary
of the war.  This program was broken down into modules and designed specifically
for use in the schools.  A set of the DVDs went to each school in Virginia.</p>"

music:  Bluegrass, Blues, Gospel, Old Time, Celtic, Alt-Country, early Jazz, classic
Country, Cajun, American roots, and on and on. </p><p>In 2004, WDVX moved into new
studios inside the new Knoxville Visitor Center in downtown Knoxville, and a brand
new tradition was born.   The Blue Plate Special, which had been a short set of
recorded music in the camper with occasional live performances, developed into
a daily live lunch-time concert before a studio audience.  Nowadays the show is
6 days a week, always at noon, and features two acts – local or touring musicians

known as ""Ardath's Army"" and quickly gained community support by traveling door-to-door
across Indianapolis and its six surrounding counties. The volunteers pushed the
station into existence in just a few short weeks by raising enough money to cover
a full year of operating expenses. The station first signed on the air with a
no-frills staff of nine employees, three black-and-white television cameras, and
a signal that reached just beyond downtown Indianapolis. WFYI was the city's first

WGBH,WGBH,Boston,MA,http://openvault.wgbh.org,"<p>WGBH Educational Foundation (GBH) traces its roots back to 1836, when textile merchant John Lowell, Jr. (of the illustrious ""Lowells of Massachusetts,"" one of America's great early families) left a bequest creating ""free public lectures for the benefit of the citizens of Boston."" In his will, Lowell set aside $250,000, half his estate, to underwrite the public lectures in perpetuity.</p><p>In the early 1940s the position of Trustee of the Lowell Institute passed to Ralph Lowell. Intrigued by the Federal Communications Commission's 1945 announcement that 20 of the 90 radio channels in the newly relocated frequency modulation (FM) band had been reserved for noncommercial stations, Lowell considered a Lowell Institute FM station as a new way to fulfill the institute's mission. Conversations with James Bryant Conant, president of Harvard University, led instead to the notion that Boston-area universities and colleges produce educational programs for broadcast on commercial AM outlets.</p><p>In 1946, the Lowell Institute Cooperative Broadcasting Council (LICBC) was formed--a cooperative venture with six Boston colleges, broadcasting lectures on commercial radio.
In April 1951, the WGBH Educational Foundation was formed, to launch an FM station that would carry the LICBC lectures. The ""GBH"" stood for Great Blue Hill, the site of the station's antenna atop a Harvard-operated weather observatory. The incorporators and original board members were Ralph Lowell (as Trustee of the Lowell Institute), the presidents and treasurers of Harvard and MIT, and the president of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.</p><p>Noncommercial radio station WGBH-FM made its initial broadcast on October 6, 1951: the first Saturday-evening performance of the BSO's 71st season, live from Boston's famed Symphony Hall. The broadcast opened with words of welcome from Ralph Lowell and BSO President Henry Cabot. It was the first full-length broadcast of a symphony concert in Boston in 25 years. Only 15 percent of the households in Greater Boston had FM receivers, but GBH's premiere foray was considered a rousing success. During its first year, WGBH-FM broadcast 2,600 hours of programming--10 times the amount the LICBC had been allotted on commercial radio.</p><p>On May 2, 1955, WGBH-TV signed on for the first time. Its first broadcast was Come and See, a program for young children with folk singer Tony Saletan and Mary Lou Adams from Tufts University Nursery Training School. That was followed by Louis Lyons (a WGBH-FM fixture) reading the news before a camera.</p><p>Most early ""Channel 2"" programs were course lectures: French Through Television, Your Income Taxes, From Criminal to Citizen. Over time, GBH made its mark by creating programs locally that were shared with other stations--this prior to the creation of the Public Broadcasting Service. Notable among them was Prospects of Mankind, a monthly series in which former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt interviewed statesmen from all over the world.
In 1962, GBH produced three programs on French cooking, after a Cambridge cookbook author appeared on a GBH book-review program and whipped up not only egg whites but an interest in how-to television. Within a year The French Chef with Julia Child was teaching audiences in several major cities to cook with courage. ""Educational TV"" had its first national star--and GBH had the first in a long line of productions that would transform American broadcasting and put the Boston station on the map.</p><p>In 2020, GBH announced a new branding, dropping the broadcast-centric ""W"" from its name and adopted a new logo. Going forward, the organization would be known as GBH to recognize GBH's commitment to on-demand and digital-first content for audiences nationwide through streaming, apps, podcasts, social media, educational curricula and virtual events.</p><p>Today, GBH is public broadcasting for New England, the number one producer of PBS programming (on TV, the Web, online, and mobile), a major source of public radio content, and a pioneer in both educational multimedia and media access solutions serving millions of people with disabilities.</p>",https://s3.amazonaws.com/americanarchive.org/org-logos/GBH_logo_purple.png,"<p>GBH’s best-known television series include Frontline, NOVA, American Experience, Masterpiece, and PBS’ #1 rated

Participants write their own scripts, create storyboards, and record their voices.
Each participant also learns how to edit photographs, add effects, and use video
software to assemble all of these elements into a “digital story.” At the end
of the workshop, WGBY invites peers, family, and community to a public screening
of the stories where participants talk about their experience in the workshop.
The screenings are remarkable, healing, and transformational. The stories give
voice to the voiceless, strengthen literacy, stimulate dialogue, and build community.
These digital stories preserve the history, culture, ideas, and legacies of our
community.</p>"

The station came into existence through efforts that included Dr. James Cheek,
then president of Howard University, Millard J. (Jim) Watkins, an engineer and
now general manager, WHUR-FM, Howard University administrators, and officials
of WETA, which had been using a trailer on the Howard University campus as one
of its first broadcast sites.  The name was later changed from WHMM to WHUT (Howard

of public attention was paid locally and nationally to the station’s start as
it was, and remains, the first and only public broadcasting (PBS) station in the
United States licensed to and operated by a predominantly African American institution,
or historically black college/university (HBCU).  The local community and Howard
University supported the station and it grew under its first manager, a commercial
broadcast veteran, Arnold Wallace.  WHMM’s first anniversary was commemorated
with an extravagant gala hosted by comedian/actor Bill Cosby, and attended by
notable African American personalities such as boxer Sugar Ray Leonard, and actors
Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis.</p><p>By its tenth year, WHUT had produced several award-winning
programs with subject matter running the gamut from arts and healthcare to public
affairs and athletics. Through this programming, the station developed a brand
as a grounded, provocative, and community focused service.  The staff produced
diverse programming delving into a multitude of topics affecting the community.
It covered religion with Worship in Washington, entertained with Comedy Jam,
and offered news, information, analysis and entertainment with Evening Exchange
and @ Howard.  In 1995, it televised, live, the historic Million Man March, making
the full event available in the over two million homes reached by WHUT’s signal.
The station also attracted national talent and served as the production center
for the nationally televised PBS variety show, With Ozzie and Ruby, which ran
from 1981-82 and for The Reading Club, produced and distributed in 1999 by Bryant
Gumbel, Renee Poussaint and Alison Davis.</p><p>WHUT has garnered over 14 Emmys and
numerous other awards for its programming.</p><p>In 2010 the station and its staff
of 16 completed its digital transition. WHUT is now broadcasting in high-definition
and standard-definition.</p><p>In January 2011 WHUT has extended its broadcast service
to the community to a 24-hour, seven day a week presence.</p><p>WHUT plays an active
role in the local community with special events and programs specifically geared
toward literacy, STEM and early-childhood education.  WHUT has been awarded an

the Federal Communications Commission.  It went on the air in 1982 with an all-volunteer
announcing staff, moving to a professional staff in 1986, when it became a public
radio affiliate of the Corporate for Public Broadcasting.  The station was the
aspiration of a cadre of UMass Boston students in 1968, in what became a fourteen
year campaign to get the station on the air.  The Worcester station, WBPR-FM,
was purchased in 1993 from Worcester county Christian Broadcasting, which owned
a permit to construct the station, but had never actually built it.  The Falmouth
station, WFPB-FM, was developed with the help of an expansion funding grant from
CPB and went on the air in 1996.  The Orleans station was a donation from GramCam
Communications in 1998, and the Newburyport station was built with the help of
a grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce in 2001.</p><p>WUMB-FM is committed to

WXXI Public Broadcasting (WXXI-TV),WXXI Public Broadcasting,Rochester,NY,http://interactive.wxxi.org/,"<p>WXXI Public Broadcasting Council was founded in 1958 as the Rochester Area Educational Television Association (RAETA), and the station's first few years were dedicated to producing instructional television programs for elementary school students. In 1959, Assignment: The World became the first educational series WXXI produced. More than fifty years later, the program went on to be the longest-running instructional TV program in the U.S., and was offered nationwide until it ceased production in 2013. On September 6, 1966, after a five-year quest for a broadcast license, Channel 21 went on the air, broadcasting 50 hours of programming a week. The following year, Congress established the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) to promote growth of the industry, which resulted in a consistent funding base for the station. In 1974 WXXI signed on with its all-classical radio station Classical 91.5, and in 1984 it signed on its NPR station on AM 1370. Today, the station owns and operates three television channels (WXXI-TV/HD, Create, and World) and operates cable City 12 in partnership with the City of Rochester. Its radio stations now include: WXXI-AM 1370, WXXI-FM 91.5, plus two HD radio channels and Reachout Radio, a closed circuit 24-hour radio reading service for those who are visually impaired.  WXXI also manages and operates WRUR-FM 88.5 in broadcast partnership with the University of Rochester, along with two radio stations in partnership with Hobart &amp; William Smith Colleges – WEOS-FM 89.7 in Geneva, NY and WITH-FM 90.1 in Ithaca, NY. WXXI also provides educational and outreach services, and a robust web site, which serves the greater Rochester community with music, science, health, and news programs that inspire, engage, educate, and inform.  In January 2012, WXXI and Rochester’s Independent Film House, Little Theatre, joined together in a formal, long-term affiliation.</p>",https://s3.amazonaws.com/americanarchive.org/org-logos/wxxi_logo.png,""

Wyoming PBS (KCWC),Wyoming PBS,Riverton,WY,http://www.wyomingpbs.org/,"<p>KCWC-TV/Wyoming PBS is a full-service, public television station
licensed to Central Wyoming College, with studio and office facilities located
in Riverton, Wyoming. The station, under call letters KCWC-TV, was built in 1982-83.
KCWC-TV signed on the air May 10, 1983, providing approximately 16 hours of programming
per day, with 10 full-time and 3 part-time staff. Initially the coverage area
served was Fremont County with 33,000 people, including the Wind River Indian
Reservation. Over the last 31 years, with the generous support of state and federal
grants combined with private donations the station has expanded its coverage area
to reach approximately 85% of Wyoming. To alleviate the confusion of various channel
numbers and a multitude of call signs for each translator, KCWC-TV started using
the title of ""Wyoming Public Television,"" which more correctly reflected its
statewide public television network. On January 1, 2008, after 25 years of service,
the station adopted a new name: Wyoming PBS. The station now has 23 full-time
staff, with approximately 5 part-time people, providing 2 channels of programming
24 hours a day.</p><p>KCWC-TV/Wyoming PBS was established for the purpose of providing
a public television service and distance learning to the citizens of Wyoming.
Recognizing that technologies have essentially eliminated time and distance, and
created a global village, the Wyoming PBS network seeks to provide a television
medium which recognizes the state's unique needs, and which informs, educates
and enriches the lives of Wyoming citizens and helps them more fully understand
and participate in local, national and global events that affect their lives.
The station seeks to balance the differing needs of its citizens by providing
a service that is open to public input with program offerings and services built
around Wyoming's needs and providing communications opportunities which would
otherwise be unavailable.</p>",https://s3.amazonaws.com/americanarchive.org/org-logos/wyoming_pbs_logo.png,"<p>Main Street, Wyoming</p><p>Wyoming Chronicle</p><p>Wyoming Perspectives</p>"
WYSO-FM (WYSO Public Radio),WYSO,Yellow Springs,OH,http://wyso.org/,"<p>WYSO Public Radio is owned and operated by Antioch College in Yellow
Springs, Ohio.  It began broadcasting in 1958 with 19 watts of power.  The student
founders promised programs “of a nature not generally available,” saying, “this
will be a community radio station.” They kept their promise.</p><p>Over the next three
decades, they conducted audio training, collected audio, and made programs covering
public affairs, international issues, local cultural and political events, lectures,
poetry readings, concerts, radio dramas and children shows. There was an outpouring
of programs.  WYSO blossomed.</p><p>Throughout the years WYSO programming has been
an energetic mix of music and news, both local and national.  </p><p>Today WYSO broadcasts
with 50,000 watts of power and distributes local and national programs from NPR
and other sources on multiple platforms.  We are no longer a student station,
but Antioch College students and community members are still involved.  Alongside
a staff of twelve, more than twenty weekly volunteers make radio every day.  In
2009, we revived community training programs and re-established the legacy of
wide-ranging recordings by community members.  They contribute award-winning feature
stories, public affairs programs, oral history interviews, and diverse music programs.</p><p>CPB’s ombudsman has called WYSO “the little station that could.”  We draw strength
from our deep engagement with our listeners through concerts, “Listening Parties,”
open houses and radio production training. Our staff and our community producers
create programming that reflects the diversity of our listening area in southwest
Ohio.  </p><p>The WYSO Digital Audio Archives reflects our history as we continue the
tradition of community involvement. </p>",https://s3.amazonaws.com/americanarchive.org/org-logos/wyso_logo.png,"<p>Since its beginning WYSO programming has included local news, public affairs, 
and a variety of music programs. Our archive collection is especially rich in 
civil rights and social justice issues.  Much of this programming was produced 
by students and community volunteers. As part of Antioch College, WYSO was 
present to record many of the musicians, writers, and public figures who 
visited and spoke on campus, most notably Dr. Martin Luther King’s 1965 
commencement address.</p><p>Today WYSO continues to produce local news and public affairs and a wealth of 
music programming created by a mix of staff and community producers.  </p>"
WYSU 88.5 FM,WYSU,Youngstown,OH,http://wysu.org/,"<p>In 1969, just two years after the proposal was first made for a fine
arts radio station in Youngstown, Ohio, with the hard work of Don Elser, first
director Steve Grcevich, and Youngstown State University president Albert Pugsley,
WYSU-FM signed on the air at 88.5 MHZ, licensed to Youngstown State University.
The date was October 23, and the time was 10:00 am, with program host Bill Foster
introducing Richard Strauss’ Also sprach Zarathustra.  The station began by broadcasting
12 hours daily from its studios in the former Valley Park Motel on Wick Avenue,
and served Youngstown State University and the Mahoning Valley community.  WYSU-FM
is a charter member of National Public Radio. Some of the first programs to air
were NPR’s All Things Considered, WYSU’s Folk Festival with Charles Darling, and
the syndicated program Adventures in Good Music with Karl Haas.  </p><p>With a small
staff, WYSU made great strides over the next decades, becoming part of the first
radio network using satellite-delivered programs in 1971, moving to new studios
in 1976, and expanding to a 24-hour broadcast day in 1980.  Also in 1980, WYSU
held its first on-air pledge drive, a practice that continues twice yearly, and
remains a major source of funding for the station.  </p><p>Under the guidance of director
Robert Peterson in the 1980s and 1990s, the station began airing Morning Edition
and operating a new 50,000 watt transmitter.  The addition of translators in nearby
Ashtabula, Ohio and New Wilmington, Pennsylvania expanded WYSU’s coverage.  In
1996, state of the art digital editing equipment was installed, and overnight
programs became automated.</p><p>In the late 1990s, WYSU collaborated with the McDonough
Museum of Contemporary Art at YSU in launching the first Mad About the Arts event
– a celebration of great art, food, music and dance.  The event is now in its
20th successful year of raising funds to support both organizations.  In 2000,
classical music host Barbara Krauss planned the first station-sponsored European
tour to Great Britain.  The tours have since taken groups of WYSU travelers all
over the world. </p><p>Gary Sexton, WYSU’s current director of broadcasting, took the
position in 2000.  Under his direction, a WYSU website (wysu.org) was established,
as well as streaming audio. By 2004, digital equipment was installed in the broadcast
studios.  WYSU began broadcasting in HD in 2007, adding an all classical HD channel
a year later.  In tandem with these advances, the station continues to produce
music and community affairs programs with local hosts and guests.  Fund drives
have continued to be successful and the staff and supporting members remain committed
to WYSU’s mission as a public radio station:  to be the community’s leading source
for trusted, in-depth news, engaging conversation, and music that stimulates the
mind and spirit.</p>",https://s3.amazonaws.com/americanarchive.org/org-logos/wysu_logo.png,"<p>Looking Out - This round-table discussion is a platform for community
